# CS 061 Machine Organization and Assembly Language
CS 061 covers two parallel tracks: Machine Organization and Assembly Language Programming. In the lecture portion of the course, you will learn about machine organization, while in the lab portion, you will focus on assembly language programming. Together, these tracks will provide a comprehensive understanding of software development, including design and implementation strategies, programming languages, environment tools, development processes, programming, testing, debugging, performance evaluation, component integration, maintenance, and documentation. By the end of the course, you will have the skills and knowledge necessary to develop efficient and effective software systems.

Course Description <br>
CS 061 is a 4-credit course that provides an introduction to computer organization, including number representation, combinational and sequential logic, computer instructions, memory organization, addressing modes, interrupt, input/output (I/O), assembly language programming, assemblers, and linkers.
